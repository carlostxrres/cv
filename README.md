## Fonts

Since performance is irrelevant, this is using four fonts form Google Fonts:

- Montserrat: just for the title
- Roboto: for secondary titles
- Roboto Condensed: for paragraphs and long texts (takes less space)
- Roboto Mono: for keywords

## To do

- [ ] Add links:

  - [ ] On the institutions
  - [x] On the email, phone, and links
  - [x] On the English CAE certificate
  - [x] On the "Anuari Politic de Catalunya"
  - [ ] On the final projects of the bootcamps
  - [x] On the certificates of the bootcamps
  - [ ] Get the actual English certificate (requires paperwork)
  - [x] Use tags to make more visually clear the technologies used in each work

## To add if I have more space

- More projects
- A volunteering section with:

  - The ones in my old CV
  - With Amazon, taught a digital literacy (check NGO)
  - Beach cleaning (check how many days, and NGO)

- A skills section
